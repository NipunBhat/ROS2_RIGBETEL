# ROS2_RIGBETEL

This repository contains all the assignments and experiments undertaken during the 2-month ROS2 Humble course with RigBetelLabs Pune.

## Assignment 1

**Objective:**  
Create a ROS2 Python package with three nodes and use a launch file to start the project.

**Solution:**  
Implemented in both C++ (`assignment1_cpp`) and Python (`assignment1`).

**Results:**

## Assignment 2

**Objective:**  
Work with the TurtleSim node to draw various shapes.

### 2.1 Displace the Turtle

- Created a node to control TurtleSim for movement.
